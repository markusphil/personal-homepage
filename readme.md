# Personal Hompage

For some time I wanted to try out the headless CMS [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) with a static page generator like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
So I thought Ã­t would bea great idea to build my personal homepage with that setup.

## CV

For starters I wanted to have a web-based CV instead of an old-school table layout pdf.
It is however not hooked up to the strapi backend yet. Instead it uses simple JSON files as data source, but already consumes those through gatsby's graphQL interface.
